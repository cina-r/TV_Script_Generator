# TV Script Generator
This is the third project of the Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree Program.  

## Problem statement
We want to build a **R**ecurrent **N**eural **N**etwork that can generate new, "fake" TV scripts.  

## Solution
We use parts of the [Seinfeld dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/thec03u5/seinfeld-chronicles#scripts.csv) of scripts from season 9. After some data pre-processing, a **Long** **S**hort-**T**erm **M**emory network with two layers is instantiated and trained.
